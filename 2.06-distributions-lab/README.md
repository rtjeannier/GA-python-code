Week 2, Lesson 6: Distributions Lab

Take notes on the distributions. Put together a chart that summarizes all of the distributions. Optimally, you'd include:

- name
- continuous vs. discrete
- parameters
- an example of when it can be used
- assumptions of the distribution
- pdf/cdf (if you so choose)

It may also be helpful to develop a flow chart that shows how the distributions relate to one another.
