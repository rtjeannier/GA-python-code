    "\n",
    "Statistics is an incredibly broad area of study. The tools we learn in statistics (and, closely related, probability) underlie most of what we're going to do in DSI, even if we sometimes gloss over all of the technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can organize most of statistics into two large sub-fields: **descriptive** statistics and **inferential** statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics** focuses on summarizing, describing, and understanding data we observe.\n",
    "- **Inferential statistics** focuses on generalizing results from a sample to a larger population.\n",

    "Sometimes we want to look at two or more variables simultaneously - perhaps understanding how one changes when the other changes, or what one looks like when the other is held constant. We generally say that, when working with **multivariate statistics**, we are interested in **understanding the relationship** between two variables or among three or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, we are only interested in one variable at a time. It does not make sense to say that we're interested in the relationship of one variable. Instead, we are interested in the **distribution** of that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the **distribution of a variable describes all possible values of the variable and how frequently the variable takes on each of those values.**\n",
