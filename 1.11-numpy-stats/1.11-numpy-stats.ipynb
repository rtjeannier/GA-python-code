    "**Intro:** What do you think of when you hear \"statistics?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is an incredibly broad area of study. The tools we learn in statistics (and, closely related, probability) underlie most of what we're going to do in DSI, even if we sometimes gloss over all of the technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can organize most of statistics into two large sub-fields: **descriptive** statistics and **inferential** statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics** focuses on summarizing, describing, and understanding data we observe.\n",
    "- **Inferential statistics** focuses on generalizing results from a sample to a larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For today, we're going to focus exclusively on _descriptive statistics._"

    "Sometimes we want to look at two or more variables simultaneously - perhaps understanding how one changes when the other changes, or what one looks like when the other is held constant. We generally say that, when working with **multivariate statistics**, we are interested in **understanding the relationship** between two variables or among three or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, we are only interested in one variable at a time. It does not make sense to say that we're interested in the relationship of one variable. Instead, we are interested in the **distribution** of that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the **distribution of a variable describes all possible values of the variable and how frequently the variable takes on each of those values.**\n",
    "\n",

    "If approximately 50% of the distribution is below the mean and approximately 50% of the distribution is above the mean, we call that distribution **symmetric**. Otherwise, we call the distribution **skewed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One _rule of thumb_ is to see if the mean and median are close to one another. If the mean is approximately equal to the median, the distribution is usually symmetric. If the mean is significantly different from the median, we say that the distribution is skewed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How far apart the mean and median are will, of course, depend on the scale of the data itself! As you can imagine, an annual income difference of 50 dollars is not much at all whereas a systolic blood pressure difference of 50 mmHg is quite substantial!\n",
    "- This is a rule of thumb and, for distributions with more than one mode, may be misleading. Be careful using only this to decide the skew of a distribution. It is always better to plot during exploratory data analysis than relying on summary statistics alone!\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewed distributions can be either **left-skewed** or **right-skewed**. Look for the \"tail\" of the distribution; if the tail is on the left, it's left-skewed! If the tail is on the right, it's right-skewed!\n",
